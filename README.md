一Confucianism has permeated into the soil of China, then other Oriental countries like Japan, the Republic of Korea, Vietnam, etc., and even the Western world. The exact time for Confucianism to land in the West was thought to be the year of 1593, when, according to the research of Professor Zhu Qianzhi, a renowned scholar from Peking University, the Italian missionary Matteo Ricci initiated the translation of the Four Books into Latin. Gradually Westerners learned about Confucius, The Analects, and Confucianism. And now, Confucianism has come to be regarded as the common cultural legacy of the whole world

二According to sociological studies, teams are significantly more productive than individuals. As the old saying goes, “United we stand, divided we fall.” Fighting alone, we are likely to lose; on the contrary, if we work together, we are bound to win. The core of team spirit is to take advantage of the personality and competence differences of the team members, bring into full play their strengths, and produce the effect of “1+1＞2” (One plus one is bigger than two; The outcomes brought about by the teamwork of two will be better than those by two members working separately; The teamwork of two will be more productive than the work of two done separately). Therefore, team members should understand and appreciate each other and work collaboratively, so as to accomplish the goal and achieve common development

三Smart technologies are reshaping city planning and construction. Beijing Daxing International Airport is a good example in employing smart technologies. Such technologies as facial recognition, paperless and self-service check-in, and a smart robotic parking system can greatly increase the working efficiency of the airport. The smart lighting system and real-time package tracking system also help improve passenger experience. The smart city programs aim at improving infrastructures and utilities, bringing more conveniences to people’s work and life. 

四The Tang Dynasty is regarded as a golden age of classic Chinese poetry, with thousands of poets producing an incredible quantity of works, among whom Li Bai, Du Fu and Bai Juyi are universally renowned. The poetry of the Tang Dynasty covers a wide range of topics, from historical events to picturesque views, from frontier warfare to love and friendship. Embodying the traditional Chinese culture and moral values, the poetry of the Tang Dynasty, profound in meaning, elegant in form, and superb in artistic aesthetics, has become a precious legacy of Chinese culture. With its unique charm, the poetry of the Tang Dynasty has also produced far-reaching influence on modern poetics and poem writing in the West.

五In 1935, Qian Xuesen travelled across the ocean and started his journey to study in the United States. His teachers and classmates were deeply impressed by his diligence and talents. In his first year at the California Institute of Technology, Qian Xuesen collected all the literature he could find on aeronautics and spent about an average of ten hours a day reading it carefully. Qian rarely stopped to chat with his classmates on campus, but was quite active in class and asked various complex questions. His talent for applied mathematics presented him the opportunity to work as a research assistant for his mentor. This experience of studying abroad laid a solid foundation for Qian’s scientific research in the future

University students come from different parts of the country with various purposes. However, a closer look at their reasons for studying at the university will enable us to classify them roughly into three groups: those who have  passion for learning, those who wish to attain a bright future, and those who learn with no definite purpose.

Firstly, there are many students who learn simply because they pursue their goal of learning. Some read a wealth of British and American novels because they are keenly interested in literature. Others sit in front of the computer screen, working on a new program, virtually day and night, because they find some computer programs fascinating, and they dream of becoming a "Bill Gates" one day.

Secondly, there are students who work hard mainly for a better and more prosperous future. It seems that the majority of students fall into this group. After admission to the university, they read books after books to acquire knowledge from all of the resources which are available to them, and finally, to succeed in the future job market.

Thirdly, there are still some students who learn without a clear goal. They take courses, finish homework, enjoy life on campus, but don't want to sample anything new or challenging. They have no idea what they will be doing after college. And they may end up with nothing in their lives.

Parents and teenagers have different or even opposite things to worry about. For example, while a mother might have a hard time understanding why her teenagers' room is always  embarrassment of dirty stuff, the teenagers are more worried about their next exams and may think it is ridiculous for their mother to insist on keeping a clean room. It is therefore important for you to appreciate the differences and learn to communicate with your teenagers properly. Otherwise, your teenagers may say nothing and shut you out of their personal lives. Their refusal to talk with you may even create emotional stress in your life.

Learning effective ways to communicate can reverse the situation of a difficult relationship, reduce the stress of your life, and lead to a friendly relationship with your teenagers. First, you should learn to discuss serious problems in daily conversations. So, important topics, such as driving a vehicle and building  romantic relationship, could be dealt with through daily conversations.

Second, learn to be an active listener. Many parents are so overwhelmed with their work that they could hardly take some time for their beloved children. Spend your time listening carefully to what your children like to talk about, and make sure your children feel they are being taken seriously. This will increase the chances of good communication.

There have been increased demands for higher education to provide students with better courses and more opportunities. To deal with this complex issue, colleges and universities are turning to the Internet for quick access to its rich educational resources.

Now the Internet has been accepted as the preferred technology to many other methods in colleges and universities. Many teachers now routinely post their teaching materials online. A growing number of schools offer at least some undergraduate courses over the Internet.

There are two different models of making use of the Internet for higher education. The first model seeks to improve existing courses by using the Internet. This model provides high-speed Internet connectivity to all students, faculty, and staff. While this model uses the Internet, it doesn't require many changes, and it keeps most existing institutional structures unchanged. 

A different, more revolutionary model regards the Internet as indispensable to an important change in higher education, for it is believed that the Internet can transform teacher-centered instruction into student-centered learning. This, as a result, will bring about basic change to our university education.

In January 2011, Daniel Hernandez saved congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords' life in a mass shooting in Tucson. He kept her alive by applying pressure to her wounds and speaking tender words of sympathy until medical people arrived. He was hailed as a hero by the public. Although his devotion to public service is remarkable in his book They Call Me a Hero: A Memoir of My Youth, Hernandez insists that he is not a hero.

Hernandez said that he initially resisted the idea of writing a book about his experience on that day of enormous tragedy. "I had been pushed by a few publishers after the incident," he said. "I thought heroes should be people who make a lifetime commitment to helping others."

However, Hernandez, now a school board member, had come to realize that he would be interested in writing a book focusing on his public service."As a young official, I've faced some big challenges, and I want young people to know that they need to face challenges and involve themselves in their communities."

When asked if he had any plan with a second book, Hernandez said his major purpose at present was to continue to serve his community and pursue his passion as advocate for education. "But I'm not going to say no," he said.

For several centuries, cricket (板球) has been a very popular sport in England. It has been enjoyed by both professional and amateur players. This super-popular game is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of 11 players. It can provide you with health benefits like building endurance, balance, and physical fitness. But for a team sport, cricket also places individual players under unusual pressure because every team player is independent of each other.

Cricket might have started in early 16th-century England. Written records present evidence of a game known as creag being played by Prince Edward at Newenden, Kent in 1301; and it is possible, despite no hard evidence, that this was a form of cricket. By the end of the 18th century, cricket had developed into a national sport of England. The growth of the British Empire led to cricket being played abroad and by the mid-19th century the first international contests were held. Cricket has had a(n) remarkable impact on popular culture in England. It has had an influence on the vocabulary of the English language, with such phrases as that's not cricket coined to describe unfair behavior in general.

Nowadays college education cost is rising sharply. More and more college students have to work in order to generate income to support themselves. But how can you prevent working from interfering with your study?

Firstly, plan your class and work schedules as far ahead as possible. Arrange your classes in a way so that you have one or two days for work.

Secondly, use time well instead of burning the midnight oil. Studying late until midnight may make you tired and take a(n) consistent toll on your health. Use those 10 minutes waiting for the bus to read a few more pages. If your job has a lot of downtime (自由支配时间), use the opportunity to do school assignments. Never try to cut corners by copying assignments from other students.

Thirdly, set a goal for your academic performance. You'll probably have to decrease your work hours, or even, if possible and necessary, withdraw from the workforce to be successful in study. After all, it is not a good idea to risk compromising your student career with part-time jobs.

Fourthly, inform all your professors, teaching assistants and employers about your situation so that they can be flexible as well. Winning their support is the best way to keep them on your side.

plagiarizing, copying a peer's test answers, and buying essays online are all ways in which college students cheat. According to a survey, nearly 80% of the students interviewed admitted cheating at some point during their educational career. The consequences are severe (严重的), ranging from a failing grade to being expelled from college. But why do students cheat? In college, the pressure to do well is very high. Students know that without satisfactory grades, their potential for success at school would be limited, so they sometimes copy their peers' answers in the exam. Besides, with today's technology, there is more information available online than ever before. Students don't have to browse the Internet long to find essays for sale. These are just some of the reasons why college students might cheat. Although colleges do everything to prevent cheating, it still goes on. And cheating becomes more extensive in some schools. But students should think about the consequences they will confront . They should stop and think about how happy and proud they will be when they earn a good grade in an

There was a time when Whitney didn’t have a lot of friends. All through high school, she just slipped in and out of “light” friendships where she didn’t find a lot of comfort or companionship . When it came time to go to college, Whitney was nervous and scared at the idea that she might have to go without friends. So, she was determined to make a change. The first week of classes, something happened that transformed Whitney’s life forever. In her English class, she asked to share their goals for the class, most of the students said their goal was to get a good grade, pass the class. Whitney uttered something entirely different: her goal was to make just one good friend. To her relief , while most of the students sat in silence, one student came to Whitney and held out his hand and introduced himself. He asked if she would be his friend. The whole room was focused silent –all eyes on the Whitney and the hand held out just in front of her. She smiled and Stretched her hand out to take his and a friendship was formed. It was a friendship that lasted all through college. It was a fr iendship from which a romance was nurtured . It was a friendship that brought two people together in marriage and steered  them through many good and bad times

1The Internet has made English learning much easier. English learners used to be obliged to spend their time in libraries looking for the books that would help them in their language studies. It was very inconvenient because a lot of materials could only be found in tedious and uninteresting textbooks and readers. But today authentic content on a variety of subjects is only a click away. This is especially beneficial for those who wants to learn English earnestly.

In order to achieve fluency in English, you need to be comfortable using at least 10,000 words. The abundant materials on the Internet make it possible for you to choose appropriate content to read and listen to. These materials can be adjusted to your level if you input some key words in the search engine. But how can you remember the bulk of unfamiliar words?

In this case, the Internet evidently makes it easier to learn vocabulary. You can use online dictionaries to instantly find out their grammatical functions and the specific meaning of these words. The Internet helps you to efficiently accumulate vocabulary based on lively and interesting language content, which greatly reduces your distress caused by inability to remember the new words. The efficiency of this vocabulary learning is one of the reasons why the Internet has become an ideal place to learn English

Through exploration of the humanities, we learn how to think creatively and critically, to analyze, and to ask questions. Because these skills allow us to gain new insight into everything from poetry and paintings to business models and politics, humanistic subjects have been at the heart of a liberal arts education since the ancient Greeks first used them to educate their citizens.

Research into the human experience helps to boost our knowledge about our world. Through the work of humanities scholars, we learn about the values of different cultures, about what goes into making a work of art, and about the mystery of how history is made. Their efforts depict the great accomplishments of the past, help us understand the world today, and give us tools to imagine the prospect of our future.

Today, humanistic knowledge continues to promote the ideal foundation for exploring and understanding the human experience. Learning another language might help to invest you with great insights as well as gain much appreciation of different cultures. Taking a close look at a sculpture might make you think about how an artist's life affected his creative decisions. Reading a book from another region of the world might help you speculate about the meaning of democracy. Listening to history courses might give you a clearer picture of what the future will be like

There is a special life stage that our generation goes through. It is the transition period, during which we move from teenage to adolescence. We learn who we are and what we stand for and what inspires us. Also, in this period we are saddled with a lot of pressure from our parents who want us to make something out of ourselves.

My parents have already expressed feelings of anxiety over my future with academics and life. When I expressed to them recently that I would not mind graduating in five years instead of four in order to study abroad to acquaint myself with the world, they seemed so shocked. That idea sounded foreign and to them was equivalent to lack of ambition.

Apart from that, my mother has expressed to me that she is worried that I am not searching for a boyfriend. I resent this stupid idea of marrying out of college since it does not suit me one bit. Women today can get what they want out of life without a man, even children, as it becomes more acceptable for women to adopt children.

I personally want to stay in school as long as I can to reinforce my academic work, possibly complete a law degree and start a career, and then after, and only after, begin to think about shifting to marriage. If my math is correct, that means I will be more or less "ready" for marriage at the age of 29 or 30, the age when my mother had me.

Traditional dating is a self-paced, general meeting of two people. The two usually commence with spending extra time together, getting to know one another and seeing how tempting they could be to each other. A good example is a man meeting a woman and sensing her charm. He then extends a formal invitation for a date. With traditional dating, you get to go at a steady pace, allowing yourself and your date to get to know each other through extensive contact.

There are many components that can be expected from traditional dates. Men, who are supposed to display these traditional values, will open the door for the woman, stand up when she leaves the table, pay for everything, and proceed to the next move. In the1950s, a man would usually ask a woman out several days ahead for a specific date and time. If she accepted, they would arrange for a time to pick her up. He would then take her to a dinner and a movie.

Today the rules of traditional dating are less clear. Twenty years ago, if a young lady asked a men out on a date, it was thought to be weird. Now, women are being encouraged to take the initiative and ask men out. A date may consist of a brief meeting at a café or a trip to the local art museum. Men often pay on the first date, but the woman may offer to go Dutch. The traditional dating style has been found much less common now


5To spend or save is a question which many people have. There is always a(n) dilemma whether one should spend the money that he has earned or save that money for the future. Well, there is no explicit answer to the question as different people have different perspectives on their life, and that is the reason why some people tend to spend all the money earned while others retain control over their money. People who spend all the money do not think much about the future. The only thing that they enjoy doing most is to derive pleasure from spending money. For example, if they like a particular car, mobile phone or laptop, they will buy it without giving it a thought. For them, the most important thing is to satisfy their material appetite. People who have their first job or who haven't married often fall in this category. In the long run, saving is a good option for one's life as saving helps an individual to plan for future urgent needs. That is also the reason why many people save money for a rainy day. Individuals who can suspend their spending save money successfully. Instead of buying on impulse, they delay their purchasing decision and won't be easily manipulated by commercial ads. Individuals who have responsibility for their family belong to this category.

Simplifying is not necessarily about less. It can be about more: more time, more enjoyment, more accomplishment, and more of what profit you. If you do a lot of things that don't bring you joy or support your long-term plan, then doing less of that kind of things makes sense because you can't preserve everything. The purpose of simplifying is to remove what's not important.To understand what should be discarded, try to think of activities and things as either assets or obligations. An asset is something that is valuable. Some corresponding examples are stocks, bonds, buildings, land, gold, etc., but a little more broadly, an asset is anything that can strengthen and motivate you, moving you closer to your goals. However, obligations are debts. An obligation is anything that weakens you, moves you farther from your goals, provides negative stress, creates anxiety, and decreases your health. Then how can you implement the idea of simplifying? Think about your daily activities and start with just one area. For example, you may begin with obligations by making a long list of your daily activities. Your list may revolve around such routines as paying bills and planning a birthday party for a friend, etc. Do the activities get you closer to your goals? If not, modify the list. Remove what is unnecessary in order to concentrate more on something important in your life.

It's obvious that women have come a long way as successful professionals. Women in the workplace are flourishing as an increased number of women have made their presence felt in many industries and professions. The sector of the female workforce has expanded with more and more strength and thus has its genuine importance in the professional world.

Whether they like it or not, men have to accept that women are marching up the management ladder confidently and diplomatically. Women used to be much more "quiet and passive" due to the relatively small number of female employees in comparison to males. Women today, on the other hand, have begun seeking their administrative positions by using all their powers of intelligence.

Men are hierarchical and jealous of the "beauty power" that allows women to get certain things based on their physical assets. Even though there is a dispute whether many professional females got into positions of power by using their appearance to their advantage, the valid fact is the majority of women have worked hard to achieve their desired success.

Women were considered as  bystanders in the workplace for many years and it was believed that the only jobs that they could handle were those of teachers or secretaries, but today's women can not only hold their own positions in the workplace, but they also have the dual task of raising their families.


The animal rights movement is a social movement which seeks an end to using animals in the research, food, clothing, and entertainment industries, hence being called animal liberation. It advocates the idea that the most basic interests of non-human creatures should be  afforded the same consideration as those of human beings.

Advocates lobby for animal rights from different aspects, ranging from the focus on animal suffering in laboratories to the argument that insists on not casting animals as properties of human beings. Despite the different approaches, advocates broadly consent to the opinion that animals should be viewed as non-human members of the moral community and should be omitted from being food, clothing, entertainment, or research subjects. The idea of awarding rights to animals wins the support of several prominent scholars.

However, some critics argue that animals are unable to enter into a social contract or moral compass and for that reason cannot be granted rights. Only humans have duties and, therefore, only humans have rights. There is nothing wrong or evil about using animals as resources so long as there is no unnecessary suffering. From within the animal rights movement itself, there has also been criticism of certain forms of animal rights activism, in particular the destruction of fur farms and animal laboratories.

	2、和分组函数一同查询的字段最好是分组后的字段
	3、分组筛选
			针对的表	位置			关键字
	分组前筛选：	原始表		group by的前面		where
	分组后筛选：	分组后的结果集	group by的后面		having
	
	4、可以按多个字段分组，字段之间用逗号隔开
	5、可以支持排序
	6、having后可以支持别名

## 进阶6：多表连接查询

	笛卡尔乘积：如果连接条件省略或无效则会出现
	解决办法：添加上连接条件
	
一、传统模式下的连接 ：等值连接——非等值连接


	1.等值连接的结果 = 多个表的交集
	2.n表连接，至少需要n-1个连接条件
	3.多个表不分主次，没有顺序要求
	4.一般为表起别名，提高阅读性和性能
	
二、sql99语法：通过join关键字实现连接

	含义：1999年推出的sql语法
	支持：
	等值连接、非等值连接 （内连接）
	外连接
	交叉连接
	
	语法：
	
	select 字段，...
	from 表1
	【inner|left outer|right outer|cross】join 表2 on  连接条件
	【inner|left outer|right outer|cross】join 表3 on  连接条件
	【where 筛选条件】
	【group by 分组字段】
	【having 分组后的筛选条件】
	【order by 排序的字段或表达式】
	
	好处：语句上，连接条件和筛选条件实现了分离，简洁明了！

	
三、自连接

案例：查询员工名和直接上级的名称

sql99

	SELECT e.last_name,m.last_name
	FROM employees e
	JOIN employees m ON e.`manager_id`=m.`employee_id`;

sql92

	
	SELECT e.last_name,m.last_name
	FROM employees e,employees m 
	WHERE e.`manager_id`=m.`employee_id`;


## 进阶7：子查询

含义：

	一条查询语句中又嵌套了另一条完整的select语句，其中被嵌套的select语句，称为子查询或内查询
	在外面的查询语句，称为主查询或外查询

特点：

	1、子查询都放在小括号内
	2、子查询可以放在from后面、select后面、where后面、having后面，但一般放在条件的右侧
	3、子查询优先于主查询执行，主查询使用了子查询的执行结果
	4、子查询根据查询结果的行数不同分为以下两类：
	① 单行子查询
		结果集只有一行
		一般搭配单行操作符使用：> < = <> >= <= 
		非法使用子查询的情况：
		a、子查询的结果为一组值
		b、子查询的结果为空
		
	② 多行子查询
		结果集有多行
		一般搭配多行操作符使用：any、all、in、not in
		in： 属于子查询结果中的任意一个就行
		any和all往往可以用其他查询代替
	
## 进阶8：分页查询

应用场景：

	实际的web项目中需要根据用户的需求提交对应的分页查询的sql语句

语法：

	select 字段|表达式,...
	from 表
	【where 条件】
	【group by 分组字段】
	【having 条件】
	【order by 排序的字段】
	limit 【起始的条目索引，】条目数;

特点：

	1.起始条目索引从0开始
	
	2.limit子句放在查询语句的最后
	
	3.公式：select * from  表 limit （page-1）*sizePerPage,sizePerPage
	假如:
	每页显示条目数sizePerPage
	要显示的页数 page

## 进阶9：联合查询

引入：
	union 联合、合并

语法：

	select 字段|常量|表达式|函数 【from 表】 【where 条件】 union 【all】
	select 字段|常量|表达式|函数 【from 表】 【where 条件】 union 【all】
	select 字段|常量|表达式|函数 【from 表】 【where 条件】 union  【all】
	.....
	select 字段|常量|表达式|函数 【from 表】 【where 条件】

特点：

	1、多条查询语句的查询的列数必须是一致的
	2、多条查询语句的查询的列的类型几乎相同
	3、union代表去重，union all代表不去重


## DML语言

### 插入

语法：
	insert into 表名(字段名，...)
	values(值1，...);

特点：

	1、字段类型和值类型一致或兼容，而且一一对应
	2、可以为空的字段，可以不用插入值，或用null填充
	3、不可以为空的字段，必须插入值
	4、字段个数和值的个数必须一致
	5、字段可以省略，但默认所有字段，并且顺序和表中的存储顺序一致

### 修改

修改单表语法：

	update 表名 set 字段=新值,字段=新值
	【where 条件】
修改多表语法：

	update 表1 别名1,表2 别名2
	set 字段=新值，字段=新值
	where 连接条件
	and 筛选条件


### 删除

方式1：delete语句 

单表的删除： ★
	delete from 表名 【where 筛选条件】

多表的删除：
	delete 别名1，别名2
	from 表1 别名1，表2 别名2
	where 连接条件
	and 筛选条件;


方式2：truncate语句

	truncate table 表名


两种方式的区别【面试题】
	
	#1.truncate不能加where条件，而delete可以加where条件
	
	#2.truncate的效率高一丢丢
	
	#3.truncate 删除带自增长的列的表后，如果再插入数据，数据从1开始
	#delete 删除带自增长列的表后，如果再插入数据，数据从上一次的断点处开始
	
	#4.truncate删除不能回滚，delete删除可以回滚


## DDL语句
### 库和表的管理
库的管理：

	一、创建库
	create database 库名
	二、删除库
	drop database 库名
表的管理：
	#1.创建表
	
	CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS stuinfo(
		stuId INT,
		stuName VARCHAR(20),
		gender CHAR,
		bornDate DATETIME
		
	
	);

	DESC studentinfo;
	#2.修改表 alter
	语法：ALTER TABLE 表名 ADD|MODIFY|DROP|CHANGE COLUMN 字段名 【字段类型】;
	
	#①修改字段名
	ALTER TABLE studentinfo CHANGE  COLUMN sex gender CHAR;
	
	#②修改表名
	ALTER TABLE stuinfo RENAME [TO]  studentinfo;
	#③修改字段类型和列级约束
	ALTER TABLE studentinfo MODIFY COLUMN borndate DATE ;
	
	#④添加字段
	
	ALTER TABLE studentinfo ADD COLUMN email VARCHAR(20) first;
	#⑤删除字段
	ALTER TABLE studentinfo DROP COLUMN email;
	
	
	#3.删除表
	
	DROP TABLE [IF EXISTS] studentinfo;

	


### 常见类型

	整型：
		
	小数：
		浮点型
		定点型
	字符型：
	日期型：
	Blob类型：



### 常见约束

	NOT NULL
	DEFAULT
	UNIQUE
	CHECK
	PRIMARY KEY
	FOREIGN KEY

## 数据库事务
### 含义
	通过一组逻辑操作单元（一组DML——sql语句），将数据从一种状态切换到另外一种状态

### 特点
	（ACID）
	原子性：要么都执行，要么都回滚
	一致性：保证数据的状态操作前和操作后保持一致
	隔离性：多个事务同时操作相同数据库的同一个数据时，一个事务的执行不受另外一个事务的干扰
	持久性：一个事务一旦提交，则数据将持久化到本地，除非其他事务对其进行修改

相关步骤：

	1、开启事务
	2、编写事务的一组逻辑操作单元（多条sql语句）
	3、提交事务或回滚事务

### 事务的分类：

隐式事务，没有明显的开启和结束事务的标志

	比如
	insert、update、delete语句本身就是一个事务


显式事务，具有明显的开启和结束事务的标志

		1、开启事务
		取消自动提交事务的功能
		
		2、编写事务的一组逻辑操作单元（多条sql语句）
		insert
		update
		delete
		
		3、提交事务或回滚事务
### 使用到的关键字

	set autocommit=0;
	start transaction;
	commit;
	rollback;
	
	savepoint  断点
	commit to 断点
	rollback to 断点


### 事务的隔离级别:

事务并发问题如何发生？

	当多个事务同时操作同一个数据库的相同数据时
事务的并发问题有哪些？

	脏读：一个事务读取到了另外一个事务未提交的数据
	不可重复读：同一个事务中，多次读取到的数据不一致
	幻读：一个事务读取数据时，另外一个事务进行更新，导致第一个事务读取到了没有更新的数据
	
如何避免事务的并发问题？

	通过设置事务的隔离级别
	1、READ UNCOMMITTED
	2、READ COMMITTED 可以避免脏读
	3、REPEATABLE READ 可以避免脏读、不可重复读和一部分幻读
	4、SERIALIZABLE可以避免脏读、不可重复读和幻读
	
设置隔离级别：

	set session|global  transaction isolation level 隔离级别名;
查看隔离级别：

	select @@tx_isolation;
	


## 视图
含义：理解成一张虚拟的表

视图和表的区别：
	
		使用方式	占用物理空间
	
	视图	完全相同	不占用，仅仅保存的是sql逻辑
	
	表	完全相同	占用

视图的好处：


	1、sql语句提高重用性，效率高
	2、和表实现了分离，提高了安全性

### 视图的创建
	语法：
	CREATE VIEW  视图名
	AS
	查询语句;
### 视图的增删改查
	1、查看视图的数据 ★
	
	SELECT * FROM my_v4;
	SELECT * FROM my_v1 WHERE last_name='Partners';
	
	2、插入视图的数据
	INSERT INTO my_v4(last_name,department_id) VALUES('虚竹',90);
	
	3、修改视图的数据
	
	UPDATE my_v4 SET last_name ='梦姑' WHERE last_name='虚竹';
	
	
	4、删除视图的数据
	DELETE FROM my_v4;
### 某些视图不能更新
	包含以下关键字的sql语句：分组函数、distinct、group  by、having、union或者union all
	常量视图
	Select中包含子查询
	join
	from一个不能更新的视图
	where子句的子查询引用了from子句中的表
### 视图逻辑的更新
	#方式一：
	CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW test_v7
	AS
	SELECT last_name FROM employees
	WHERE employee_id>100;
	
	#方式二:
	ALTER VIEW test_v7
	AS
	SELECT employee_id FROM employees;
	
	SELECT * FROM test_v7;
### 视图的删除
	DROP VIEW test_v1,test_v2,test_v3;
### 视图结构的查看	
	DESC test_v7;
	SHOW CREATE VIEW test_v7;

## 存储过程

含义：一组经过预先编译的sql语句的集合
好处：

	1、提高了sql语句的重用性，减少了开发程序员的压力
	2、提高了效率
	3、减少了传输次数

分类：

	1、无返回无参
	2、仅仅带in类型，无返回有参
	3、仅仅带out类型，有返回无参
	4、既带in又带out，有返回有参
	5、带inout，有返回有参
	注意：in、out、inout都可以在一个存储过程中带多个
### 创建存储过程
语法：

	create procedure 存储过程名(in|out|inout 参数名  参数类型,...)
	begin
		存储过程体

	end

类似于方法：

	修饰符 返回类型 方法名(参数类型 参数名,...){

		方法体;
	}

注意

	1、需要设置新的结束标记
	delimiter 新的结束标记
	示例：
	delimiter $

	CREATE PROCEDURE 存储过程名(IN|OUT|INOUT 参数名  参数类型,...)
	BEGIN
		sql语句1;
		sql语句2;

	END $

	2、存储过程体中可以有多条sql语句，如果仅仅一条sql语句，则可以省略begin end

	3、参数前面的符号的意思
	in:该参数只能作为输入 （该参数不能做返回值）
	out：该参数只能作为输出（该参数只能做返回值）
	inout：既能做输入又能做输出


#调用存储过程
	call 存储过程名(实参列表)
## 函数


### 创建函数

学过的函数：LENGTH、SUBSTR、CONCAT等
语法：

	CREATE FUNCTION 函数名(参数名 参数类型,...) RETURNS 返回类型
	BEGIN
		函数体
	
	END

### 调用函数
	SELECT 函数名（实参列表）





### 函数和存储过程的区别

			关键字		调用语法	返回值			应用场景
	函数		FUNCTION	SELECT 函数()	只能是一个		一般用于查询结果为一个值并返回时，当有返回值而且仅仅一个
	存储过程	PROCEDURE	CALL 存储过程()	可以有0个或多个		一般用于更新


## 流程控制结构

### 系统变量
一、全局变量

作用域：针对于所有会话（连接）有效，但不能跨重启

	查看所有全局变量
	SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES;
	查看满足条件的部分系统变量
	SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE '%char%';
	查看指定的系统变量的值
	SELECT @@global.autocommit;
	为某个系统变量赋值
	SET @@global.autocommit=0;
	SET GLOBAL autocommit=0;

二、会话变量

作用域：针对于当前会话（连接）有效

	查看所有会话变量
	SHOW SESSION VARIABLES;
	查看满足条件的部分会话变量
	SHOW SESSION VARIABLES LIKE '%char%';
	查看指定的会话变量的值
	SELECT @@autocommit;
	SELECT @@session.tx_isolation;
	为某个会话变量赋值
	SET @@session.tx_isolation='read-uncommitted';
	SET SESSION tx_isolation='read-committed';

### 自定义变量
一、用户变量

声明并初始化：

	SET @变量名=值;
	SET @变量名:=值;
	SELECT @变量名:=值;
赋值：

	方式一：一般用于赋简单的值
	SET 变量名=值;
	SET 变量名:=值;
	SELECT 变量名:=值;


	方式二：一般用于赋表 中的字段值
	SELECT 字段名或表达式 INTO 变量
	FROM 表;

使用：

	select @变量名;

二、局部变量

声明：

	declare 变量名 类型 【default 值】;
赋值：

	方式一：一般用于赋简单的值
	SET 变量名=值;
	SET 变量名:=值;
	SELECT 变量名:=值;


	方式二：一般用于赋表 中的字段值
	SELECT 字段名或表达式 INTO 变量
	FROM 表;

使用：

	select 变量名



二者的区别：

			作用域			定义位置		语法
用户变量	当前会话		会话的任何地方		加@符号，不用指定类型
局部变量	定义它的BEGIN END中 	BEGIN END的第一句话	一般不用加@,需要指定类型

### 分支
一、if函数
	语法：if(条件，值1，值2)
	特点：可以用在任何位置

二、case语句

语法：

	情况一：类似于switch
	case 表达式
	when 值1 then 结果1或语句1(如果是语句，需要加分号) 
	when 值2 then 结果2或语句2(如果是语句，需要加分号)
	...
	else 结果n或语句n(如果是语句，需要加分号)
	end 【case】（如果是放在begin end中需要加上case，如果放在select后面不需要）

	情况二：类似于多重if
	case 
	when 条件1 then 结果1或语句1(如果是语句，需要加分号) 
	when 条件2 then 结果2或语句2(如果是语句，需要加分号)
	...
	else 结果n或语句n(如果是语句，需要加分号)
	end 【case】（如果是放在begin end中需要加上case，如果放在select后面不需要）


特点：
	可以用在任何位置

三、if elseif语句

语法：

	if 情况1 then 语句1;
	elseif 情况2 then 语句2;
	...
	else 语句n;
	end if;

特点：
	只能用在begin end中！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！


三者比较：
			应用场合
	if函数		简单双分支
	case结构	等值判断 的多分支
	if结构		区间判断 的多分支


### 循环

语法：


	【标签：】WHILE 循环条件  DO
		循环体
	END WHILE 【标签】;
	
特点：

	只能放在BEGIN END里面

	如果要搭配leave跳转语句，需要使用标签，否则可以不用标签

	leave类似于java中的break语句，跳出所在循环！！！
